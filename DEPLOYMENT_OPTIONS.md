# Deployment Options for Your Next.js App

You have several options to deploy your ChatGPT clone to a public URL:

## Option 1: Vercel (Recommended for Next.js) ⭐
- **Why**: Made by Next.js creators, zero-config, free tier
- **URL**: `https://your-project.vercel.app`
- **Setup**: Already configured with GitHub Actions
- **Pros**: Fastest, easiest, optimized for Next.js
- **Cons**: None really, it's free and works great

## Option 2: Netlify
- **Why**: Great alternative, also free tier
- **URL**: `https://your-project.netlify.app`
- **Setup**: Similar to Vercel, can connect GitHub repo
- **Pros**: Free, easy, good performance
- **Cons**: Slightly less optimized for Next.js than Vercel

## Option 3: Railway
- **Why**: Simple deployment, good free tier
- **URL**: `https://your-project.up.railway.app`
- **Setup**: Connect GitHub, auto-deploys
- **Pros**: Simple, good free tier
- **Cons**: Free tier has limits

## Option 4: Render
- **Why**: Free tier, easy setup
- **URL**: `https://your-project.onrender.com`
- **Setup**: Connect GitHub repo
- **Pros**: Free tier available
- **Cons**: Can be slower on free tier

## Option 5: AI Builders Platform (If Available)
- **Why**: Uses the deployment API you have access to
- **URL**: `https://your-project.ai-builders.space`
- **Setup**: Requires Dockerfile (designed for FastAPI, but can adapt)
- **Pros**: Part of your learning platform
- **Cons**: Need to create Dockerfile for Next.js

**For Next.js apps, Vercel is the best choice** because:
- It's made by the Next.js team
- Zero configuration needed
- Free tier is generous
- Fastest deployment
- Already set up in your project
